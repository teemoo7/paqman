# Paqman

Paqman is a basic Java implementation of the famous **PacMan** game :space_invader: :space_invader: :space_invader: 
:space_invader: :yum:, with a vintage look and feel.

It was developed as a side project, because it was the very first game I played on a computer, and I wanted to see how
it could be made. It was also inspired from several other projects I found on the internet, and I wanted to make my own.
